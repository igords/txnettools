 ICMP messages are sent using the basic IP header.  The first octet of the data
 portion of the datagram is a ICMP type field; the value of this field
 determines the format of the remaining data.

Unless otherwise noted under the individual format descriptions, the values of
the internet header fields are as follows:
    * Version: 4
    * IHL: Internet header length in 32-bit words
    * Type of Service: 0
    * Total length: length of internet header and data in octets
    * Identification, flags, fragment offset: used in fragmentation
    * TTL: time to live in seconds
    * Protocol: ICMP = 1
    * Header checksum: The 16 bit one's complement of the one's complement sum
            of all 16 bit words in the header. For computing the checksum, the
            checksum field should be zero.
    * Source address: address of the gateway or host that composes the ICMP
            message. Unless otherwise noted, this can be any of a gateway's
            addresses.
    * Destination address: The address of the gateway or host to which the
            message should be sent.
